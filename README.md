**A Review of Octo: An Open-Source Generalist Robot Policy**  
Written as part of the Learning-Based Control Seminar at Institute for Data Science in Mechanical Engineering, RWTH Aachen (Nov 2024 – Jan 2025)

## Paper Overview
This repository contains the review paper written on *Octo*, a transformer-based Generalist Robot Policy (GRP). The paper analyzes:
- Octo’s architectural innovations, including diffusion-based action generation and unified token representation.
- Its performance compared to other state-of-the-art GRPs.
- Its adaptability to multi-embodiment robotic tasks.
- Utilization of data from the **Open X-Embodiment dataset**, the largest robotics dataset to date.
- The role of **Blockwise masked attention** in processing multi-modal inputs efficiently.
- The effectiveness of **Zero-shot and Few-shot learning** in adapting Octo to unseen robots and tasks.
- A comparative study of **training on Open X-Embodiment datasets** and its influence on generalization.
